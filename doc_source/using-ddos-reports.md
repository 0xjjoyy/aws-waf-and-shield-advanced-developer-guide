# Reviewing DDoS Incidents<a name="using-ddos-reports"></a>

AWS Shield Advanced provides real\-time metrics and reports for extensive visibility into attacks on your AWS resources\. Details about active and past incidents that have occurred in the last 12 months include attack type, start time, and duration\. For a description of each of the attack types, see [Types of DDoS Attacks](ddos-overview.md#types-of-ddos-attacks)\. Choose a specific incident to review additional details\. 

These metrics and reports are available only for AWS Shield Advanced customers\. To activate AWS Shield Advanced, see [To enable and configure AWS Shield Advanced](enable-ddos-prem.md#enable-ddos-prem-procedure)\.

**To review DDoS incidents**

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the AWS WAF console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/waf/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/waf/)\. 

1. Choose **Incidents**\.

1. Choose the **Incident type** of the attack you want to investigate\.

If you determine a possible attack is underway, you can contact the DRT through the [AWS Support Center](https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home#/), or attempt to mitigate the attack on your own by creating a new web access control list \(web ACL\)\. 

**To mitigate a potential DDoS attack**

1. Create conditions in AWS WAF that match the unusual behavior\.

1. Add those conditions to one or more AWS WAF rules\.

1. Add those rules to a web ACL and configure the web ACL to count the requests that match the rules\.

1. Monitor those counts to determine if the source of the requests should be blocked\. If the volume of requests continue to be unusually high, change your web ACL to block those requests\.

   For more information, see [Creating a Web ACL](web-acl-creating.md)\.

AWS provides preconfigured templates to get you started quickly\. The templates include a set of AWS WAF rules, which can be customized to best fit your needs, designed to block common web\-based attacks\. For more information, see [AWS WAF Security Automations](https://aws.amazon.com/answers/security/aws-waf-security-automations/)\.

## Monitoring Threats Across AWS<a name="aws-shield-global-threats"></a>

If you are a Shield Advanced customer, in addition to the information provided on the **Incidents** page about attacks on your own resources, you can use the global threat environment dashboard to view trends and metrics about the DDoS threat landscape across Amazon CloudFront, Elastic Load Balancing, and Amazon RouteÂ 53\.

The global threat environment dashboard provides a near real\-time summary of the global AWS threat landscape, including the largest attack, the top attack vectors, and the relative number of significant attacks\. You can customize the dashboard view for different time durations to see the history of significant DDoS attacks\.

**To view the global threat environment dashboard**

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the AWS WAF console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/waf/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/waf/)\. 

1. Choose **Global threat environment**\.

1. Choose a time period\.

You can use the information on the global threat environment dashboard to better understand the threat landscape and help you make decisions to better protect your AWS resources\.
