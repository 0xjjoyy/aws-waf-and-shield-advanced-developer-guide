# Step 4: Deploy AWS WAF Security Automations<a name="deploy-waf-automations"></a>

AWS provides preconfigured templates that include a set of AWS WAF rules, which you can customize to best fit your needs\. These templates are designed to block common web\-based attacks such as bad bots, SQL injection, cross\-site scripting \(XSS\), HTTP floods, and known\-attacker attacks\. In addition to enabling Shield Advanced and specifying resources for Shield Advanced protection, you also should use these preconfigured templates\. 

For more information, see [AWS WAF Security Automations](https://aws.amazon.com/answers/security/aws-waf-security-automations/)\. AWS WAF is included with Shield Advanced at no additional cost\.
